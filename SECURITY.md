# Security Policy

The Generic Trust Anchor API community takes the security of its code
seriously. If you think you have found a security vulnerability, please read
the next sections and follow the instructions to report your finding.

## Supported Versions

This project is currently under active development and has not yet reached an
official release. As such, there are no formally supported versions at this time.

Once the project reaches a stable release stage, this section will be updated to
indicate which versions are actively maintained and receive security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please DO NOT report any potential security vulnerability via a public channel
(mailing list, github issue etc.). Instead, create a report via
https://github.com/generic-trust-anchor-api/gta-cli/security/advisories/new
or [contact us via email](mailto:gta-api.t@siemens.com).

Please provide a detailed description of the issue, the steps to
reproduce it, the affected versions and, if already available, a proposal for a
fix. You should receive a response within 5 working days. If for some reason you
do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

If we confirm the issue as a vulnerability, we will publish an advisory (e.g. on
GitHub) and give credits for your report if desired. We follow the
[coordinated vulnerability disclosure](https://vuls.cert.org/confluence/display/CVD)
model and will define an appropriate disclosure timeline together with you.
